\f0\fs24 \cf0 Where Cheetahs Live\
\
Animals, includes cheetah, are adopted to live in specific habitats. Cheetahs live mainly in grassland savannah. They prefer habitat which includes some cover in the form of bushes, medium length grass, trees, and small hills. Cheetahs need abundant prey in their habitat to survive and reproduce. In Namibia their habitat is densely bushed due to bush encroachment.\
\
Cheetahs sometimes live in a wide variety of habitats. They occasionally use semi-desert, dense woodland or mountainous terrain. Older animals unable to defend territories and young cheetahs just starting to live on their own use these marginal habitats.}
