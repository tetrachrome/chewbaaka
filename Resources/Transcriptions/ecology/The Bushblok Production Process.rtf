Wood extrusion is the process of joining biomass together by the use of pressure and heat which causes natural lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses in the product to form a natural binder, there is no additive involved. The chips bond and are extruded as the compact Bushblok product, then 5). cut to size, bundled, wrapped and labeled. Finally, ready for distribution.\

Bushblok \'99, CCF\'92s award winning low emission, high-heat fuel log, is useful for cooking fired, home heating, and industrial heat applications. It is burning as hot as coal, has a small after burn ash content and is classified as a Smokeless Fuel. CCF\'92s Bushblok \'99 provides not only an opportunity\
to restore wildlife and grazing land, but also to address two of Namibia and Africa\'92s biggest issues: lack of electrification and poverty.\
