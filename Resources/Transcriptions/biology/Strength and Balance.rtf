\
Body\
\
The cheetah\'92s body is narrow and lightweight with long, slender limbs. Specialized muscles allow a greater swing to the limbs, increasing acceleration.\
\
Cheetah measurements (averages):\
\
Weight: 34-54 kg\
\
Body length: 112 - 135 cm\
\
Tail length: 66 - 84 cm\
\
Shoulder height: 73 + cm\
\
\
Tail\
\
The cheetah\'92s long muscular tail works as a rudder, stabilizing and acting as a counter balance to its body weight. This allows sudden sharp turns during high speed chases.\
\
The tail is thought to be a signaling device, helping young cheetahs follow their mother in tall grass. The tip may be black or white in color.}
