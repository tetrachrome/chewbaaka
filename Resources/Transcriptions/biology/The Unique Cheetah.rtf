\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Unique Cheetah\
\
The world\'92s fastest land animal, the cheetah, is built for speed.\
\
An acceleration from 0 to 84 km/hr in just 3 seconds, with a full speed of 110 km/hr, means that the cheetah can out-perform a sports car.\
\
How do cheetahs differ from other big cats.\
\
Cheetahs are markedly different in both anatomy and behavior from the other 36 species of cats. They are the only species in their genus. Until 1900s they were often thought to be related to dogs than cats. Cheetahs are the only big cat that cannot roar, but they can purr.\
\
They have evolved for speed versus power and aggression. Their bodies are lightweight in comparing with the build of other big cats. They rely on their speed and skills for survival.\
\
The scientific name for cheetah is 
\f1\i Acinonyx jubatus
\f0\i0 .\
\
The genus name, 
\f1\i Acinonyx
\f0\i0 , is interpreted as \'93non-moving claws\'94, referring to the semi-retractable claws.\
\
The species name, 
\f1\i jubatus
\f0\i0 , means \'93maned\'94, referring to the mantle on a young cheetah\'92s back.\
\
The English word, \'93cheetah\'94, comes from the Hindu word \'93chita\'94 meaning the \'93spotted one\'94.}
