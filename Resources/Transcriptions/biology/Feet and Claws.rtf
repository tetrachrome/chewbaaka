\f0\fs24 \cf0 Feet and Claws\
\
Cheetah\'92s foot pads are hard and less rounded than the other cats. The pad function like tire threads providing them with increased traction in fast, sharp turns.\
\
The short blunt claws work like the cleats on a track shoe. They grip the ground for traction when running and help increase speed.\
\
Cheetah\'92s claws are semi-retractable, meaning they do not completely retract like the claws of other cats. The foot structure of the cheetah is very dog-like.\
\
The dewclaws of the cheetah are located on the upper inside area of the front foot. These are sharp and frequently used to hook and hold prey.\
