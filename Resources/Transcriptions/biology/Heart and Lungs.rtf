\f0\fs24 \cf0 Heart and Lungs\
\
The cheetah has a large strong heart that rapidly pumps large amounts of oxygenated blood from the lungs to the muscles to keep them supplied with energy while running.\
\
Large lungs provide adequate oxygen for a cheetah\'92s increased energy needs while pursuing its prey. The cheetah\'92s respiratory rate climbs from 60 to 150 breathes per minute, nearly twice as fast as humans.\
\
Cheetahs have enlarged nostrils and sinuses allowing an increase in air flow to the lungs.\
\
High speeds can, however, only be maintained for 400 - 800 meters before exhaustion sets in and the body risks overheating.\
\
A cheetah running the 249km from Otjiwarongo to Windhoek would need to stop to rest more than 311 times.\
\
If it could run there without resting, it would take 2 hours and 26 minutes at 110km/hr.}
