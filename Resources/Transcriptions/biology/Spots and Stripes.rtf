Distinctive black tear stripes run from the eyes to the mouth. The stripes are thought to protect the eyes from the sun\'92s glare. It is believed they have the same function as a rifle scope, helping cheetahs focus on their prey.\

Until three months of age, cheetah cubs have a thick-silvery grey mantle down their back. The mantle helps camouflage the cubs by blending them into the shadows and grass. It also provides protection from sun and rain.\

With their mantle, cubs look like an aggressive animal called a honey badger. This may deter predators such as lions, hyenas, and eagles from attempting to kill them. This is known as \'93mimicry\'94.}
