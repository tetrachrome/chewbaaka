\
The cheetah\'92s teeth are adapted to support their eating style. By eating fast, cheetahs avoid losing their prey to other predators.\
\
The canines, \'93eye teeth\'94 or \'93fangs\'94, are used for gripping and hold while the prey is being suffocated. Cheetah\'92s canines are smaller and less developed than those of the lion or leopard.\
\
The incisors, \'93front teeth\'94, are used for plucking fur and skinning the carcasses. Straight and strong incisors are essential for quick access to the meat of the prey.\
\
The carnassial, \'93back teeth\'94 or \'93pre molars\'94, work in scissor like fashion and enable the cheetah to shear large pieces of flesh which are quickly swallowed whole. When using these teeth during feeding, cheetahs hold their heads sideways at an angle to the carcass. These blade like teeth are similar to the lion\'92s and leopard\'92s. They do not have the same function as chewing meat as those of the jackal or crushing bones like those of the hyenas.}
