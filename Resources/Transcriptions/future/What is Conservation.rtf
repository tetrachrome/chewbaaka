\f0\fs24 \cf0 What is Conservation\
\
Conservation is taking care of the environment in which we live. This means using everything wisely so some of it is left for others to use or for our own future use. The things we use are called RESOURCES. These can be almost anything: food, the air we breathe, firewood, petrol and zinc footing panels. Conservationists understand that RESOURCES ARE LIMITED and often scarce and that we must use them wisely. In Namibia, fresh water is one of our scarcest resources.\
\
Conservation also means protecting resources we may not use.\
\
Walking around, rather than stepping on a plant, is an act of conservation.\
\
Protecting a species like the cheetah from extinction is an act of conservation.\
\
Environmental education encourages the wise use of natural resources including water and land use, waste management and recycling.\
\
Conservation Biology is a field of study at universities. It combines several sciences, such as biology, ecology and genetics, to examine why there are so many types of living things on Earth and what makes some of them scarce.}
