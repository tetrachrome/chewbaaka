\f0\fs24 \cf0 With only 7,500 individuals of cheetahs left in the wild, the species is facing unprecedented pressures that are pushing its fate to the brink of extinction. Needless to say, the cheetah\'92s future lies in our hands. Despite the grim facts, we hold a positive outlook on their future. Numbers of nation governments, non-profit organizations, as well as individuals have pulled themselves together to combine their ingenuity and resourcefulness to help the cheetahs fight for a brighter future. We believe that anyone who is passionate in the cause has something to contribute, and we can only come out triumphantly if we work together to protect the cheetahs, nurture their ecosystems, and make ourselves better custodians of this planet and all living things that share it with us.}
