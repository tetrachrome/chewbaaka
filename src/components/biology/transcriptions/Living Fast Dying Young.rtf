Male coalitions\
\
A coalition consists of a male siblings of the same litter or young unrelated males that have joined together. A hierarchy develops among the males within a coalition.\
\
Young males are usually chased away from their birth range by dominant breeding males. They may establish home ranges more than 100 km away. A coalition is more successful in acquiring and holding territories and in defending kills than single males. This competition can result in mortality among males.\
\
Mortality\
\
The cheetah\'92s lifespan is poorly documented in the wild. A radio collared cheetah lived to be almost 7 years of age in Tanzania\'92s Serengeti National Park and once of CCF\'92s radio collared cheetahs in Namibia lived for over 10 years.\
\
Adult mortality is one of the most significant limiting factors for cheetah population growth and survival. Poaching, competition with large predators and farmers, and loss of habitat and prey are factors attributing to early death.\
\
Though cub deaths are high, cheetahs have evolved to reproduce rapidly in response to this mortality.}
