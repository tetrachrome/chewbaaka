\f0\fs24 \cf0 Genetic Confusion\
\
Genes are the components of living cells that pass down inherited characteristics such as brown eyes or curly hair in humans.\
\
Genetic diversity is the variety of genes in an organism or in a population. Diversity increases the likelihood that a given species can adapt and survive catastrophes such as sudden environmental changes or exposure to new diseases.\
\
Diversity is reduced when inbreeding occurs. This means members of the same family or close relatives breed only among themselves.\
\
\
How does this relate to the cheetah?\
\
Cheetahs are very closely related and have a low genetic diversity. This is due to the drastic reduction in their numbers when the population bottleneck occurred. This inbreeding and low genetic diversity may cause abnormalities.}
