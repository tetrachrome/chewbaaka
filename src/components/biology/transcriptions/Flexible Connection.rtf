\f0\fs24 \cf0 Flexible Connection\
\
The extreme flexibility of the cheetah\'92s spine is unique. This allows more extension during running, thus making both its stride length and speed possible.\
\
If the spine were stiff and the pectoral and pelvic girdles were firmly attached, the cheetah would not be able to reach 100 km / hr.\
\
The hips (pelvic girdle) pivot to increase the cheetah\'92s stride length. This allows the front and rear legs to stretch further apart when the body is fully extended. The hips and shoulders move closer together when the feet come under its body.\
\
The shoulder bone (pectoral girdle) does not attach to the collarbone, thus allowing the shoulders to move freely. This increases the length of the stride.\
