\f0\fs24 \cf0 Learning to Hunt\
\
Cheetah cubs watch their mother hunt.\
\
The mother brings live prey, such as a young gazelle, to the 9 to 12 month old cubs. She releases it in front of them and the cubs attempt to catch it.\
\
This allows the cubs to practice their hunting skills while still under her supervision. Accurate timing and coordination during a hunt are important for their future survival.}
