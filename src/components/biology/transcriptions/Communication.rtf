\ls1\ilvl0\cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Purr - as with domestic cats this sound indicates a friendly and contended mood.\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Chirp - A high pitched bird-like chirp is used by a mother calling her cubs, cheetahs greeting each other and during courtship. These calls can be heard over a long distance. The intensity of the chirp increases with excitement.\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Stutter call - A male on the trail of a female in heat will use this call. It is also used by a mother asking her cubs to follow closely.\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Growling, hissing - These sounds are associated with defense and aggression. With these vocalizations, they may lunge and slap the ground, alternatively crouching and growling.\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Bleating - This sound expresses distress and is similar to meowing.\
{\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}Inn-inn - This call is used by a mother to summon her young and alternates with chirping.\
