\
The cheetah takes smaller prey than other similar sized cats. Their strong jaws lock around the throat of the prey in what is called the \'93strangulation hold\'94, which can last up to 20 minutes.\
\
Cheetahs\'92 jaws are not as powerful as that of lions or leopards. Cheetahs have comparatively shorted canine teeth. In all cats, powerful muscles move the jaw up and down and provide vice-like strength for gripping prey.\
\
The tongue is adopted for licking and is covered with small hard spines called papillae.\
\
The papillae act like a rasp, removing the meat from the bones of the prey.\
\
Rough tongue feels similar to the texture of sandpaper.\
\
Keeping the fur clean is an important part of a cheetah\'92s life. Family members spend many hours grooming each other with their tongues. This behavior aids in the social bonding of a cheetah group.}
