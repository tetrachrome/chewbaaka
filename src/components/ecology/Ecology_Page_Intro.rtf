\f0\fs24 \cf0 Ecological studies and researches are the first step in understanding the movement, diet, and behavioral patterns of any species of wildlife, as well as the biodiversity and well-being of the entire ecosystem. In Namibia, because 90% of the cheetah population lives on farmlands alongside 80% of the country\'92s wildlife species, it is crucial to invest in ecological research and conservation efforts in order to ensure that both wildlife, livestock, and farmers can all coexist together. Education and outreach efforts are also equally important in educating people to make more sustainable utilizations of the land and its resources, and preserve the richness in biodiversity and land fertility for future generations.}
