\f0\fs24 \cf0 Understanding Animal Movement\
\
To understand how cheetahs use their habitat you must be able to identify individual animals and record their position periodically. Individual photos or distinctive collars would be useful is cheetahs were frequently sighted, but they are not. Trackers may note the spoor (tracks) of a particular cheetah at various places and estimates when they were made. This is difficult due to the large ranges they cover and the fact that individuals are hard to identify.\
\
The preferred method to study cheetah movement is to radio-track individuals. A lightweight collar carrying a  battery pack and a small transmitter is fitted around the cheetah\'92s neck. The scientist uses a receiver and a special directional antenna (either in the ground or from a plane) to pick up the cheetah\'92s signal. The receive transmit the signal into beeps. Each collar\'92s transmitter has a different radio frequency so that many cheetahs can be located during one \'93radio-tracking session\'94.}
