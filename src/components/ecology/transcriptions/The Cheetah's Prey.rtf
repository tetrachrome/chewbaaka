\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Cheetah\'92s Prey\
\
Cheetahs hunt mostly small antelope, young of large antelope, warthog, hare and game birds. They may take livestock in exceptional or opportunistic cases.\
\
Cheetahs prefer game to livestock\
\
The cheetah\'92s lightweight build limits the size of prey ___. Male coalitions can, however, overcome larger prey. Coalitions also stand a better chance at defeating their prey against competitors than single cheetahs.\
\
Predators have to work very hard to catch their prey. Cheetahs need to carefully select the animal they are most likely to catch. For this reason cheetahs, like all other predators, target animals that are old, sick, very young, injured, or slow. This allows only the strongest to survive and pass on their genes, thus maintaining a healthier game population.\
