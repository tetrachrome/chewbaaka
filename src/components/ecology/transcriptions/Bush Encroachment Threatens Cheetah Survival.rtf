\f0\fs24 \cf0 Bush Encroachment Threatens Cheetah Survival\
\
Cheetahs hunt in open or semi-open savannah using bursts of speed. But Namibia\'92s livestock farmlands, where 90% of the cheetahs live, are less desirable for the cheetahs and the farmers due to bush encroachment. Bush encroachment, a form of desertification, is caused from overgrazing of livestock on the arid lands and unpredictable and regular droughts.\
\
The deep rooted thorn bushes reduce the water table and compete with the grasses and become a thicket, taking the underground water and causing desertation. Bush encroachment causes changes in habitats and the mix of prey species on the land.\
\
The cheetah\'92s rangeland has been infested with undesirable thickened thorn bush species. Bush encroachment reduces the amount of grasslands and poses a major livelihood threat to Namibians, as well as to the cheetah and other wildlife species.\

Cheetah Conservation Fund\'92s (CCF) Bush Project\
\
CCF Bush (PTY) LTD, began in 2000, with the support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to study and develop an ecologically and economically viable habitat restoration program. The goal of CCF Bush is to stimulate the development of a Namibian Biomass industry, thereby protecting the bush ecosystem, restoring wildlife habitat, improving farming productivity, creating employment opportunities and providing clean, renewable energy.\
\
CCF harvests the thickened thorn bush, converting it into a clean-burning, biomass fuel log known asa Bushblok \'99. CCF has restored hundreds of hectares of savannah grasslands for livestock, wildlife and cheetahs to share. In 2006, CCF obtained Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, confirming that it manages forest resources responsibly and sustainably.\
\
The Bushblok project objectives are:\
