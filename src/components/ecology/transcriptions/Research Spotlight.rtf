Population Census Techniques\
\
\
Estimating population size is crucial in species conservation.\
\
Conducting a repeatable and consistent census methodology for cheetahs has been a part of the Cheetah Conservation Fund\'92s (CCF\'92s) on-going research.\
\
CCF\'92s researchers use spoor tracking, radio telemetry and camera trapping. These techniques are tested and compared to determine whether one technique produces better census result.\
\
\
Radio Telemetry\
\
CCF tracked cheetahs by airplane, as well as on the ground one to two times per week between 1992 and 2002. Today CCF uses satellite collars for tracking cheetahs.\
\
Radio telemetry analysis was utilized as a comparative method to assess the precision of spoor tracking results.\
\
\
Spoor Tracking\
\
Spoor tracking data is collected monthly by driving specific routes.\
\

Spoor frequency is calculated by dividing the total distance between the numbers of samples of fresh spoor.\
\
Spoor density is calculated by dividing the number of fresh spoor between the total distances. Spoor tracking provided promising as a census technique as it displayed a positive relationship with the densities reported in the radio telemetry study.\
\
\
Camera Trapping\
\
Three study areas, each at 200 km sqr are divided into grids. These areas combined are equal to the size of a cheetah\'92s home range area.\
\
A camera trap location is allocated to the study areas; this takes periods of ground trothing in order to identify play trees and suitable farm roads where cameras can be placed.\
\
Two heat sensor monitor cameras are used at each camera trap site in order for both sides of a cheetah to be captured - this allows for more accurate identification.\
\
Using camera traps, CCF researchers are able to determine the amount of male and female cheetahs by individually identifying each of the cheetahs captured on camera. Analysis allows for an estimate of the population size within the study area.\
\
After collecting and processing photos on computers, identification can begin.\
