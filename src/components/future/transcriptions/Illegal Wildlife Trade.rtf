\f0\fs24 \cf0 Illegal Wildlife Trade\
\
The illegal trafficking of cheetahs into the pet trade has become one of the main threats to cheetah survival.\
\
Since 2005, CCF has been actively involved with issues involving the illegal trade of live cheetah cubs. Staff monitor cheetah trafficking activities and organizes confiscations through proper authorities when possible.\
\
Cheetahs are listed as an Appendix I species under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). They are poaches from the wild for the pet trade and their body parts, which get sold on the markets. Illegal wildlife trafficking is one of the top five transnational crimes, generating an estimated U.S. $50-150 million in illegal revenues annually.\
\
CCF is taking a leadership role in addressing the illegal pet trade. CCF trains wildlife officers involved in the front lines of trafficking in the Horn of Africa as well as in the Middle East, teaching them proper care for confiscated animals.\
\
CCF has built the most extensive database on cheetah trafficking, recording hundreds of trafficking cases going through the Horn of Africa to the Middle East.\
\
CCF participates in the CITES inter-sessional working group on the illegal trade in cheetah and was instrumental in making recommendations adopted by CITES at CoP17 to stop the illegal cheetah pet trade.}
