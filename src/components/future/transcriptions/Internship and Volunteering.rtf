Cheetah Conservation Fund\'92s commitment to scientific research has helped grow the next generation of conservation scientists and environmentalists.\
\
Internships\
\
CCF welcomes a selected number of students each year with a wide variety of backgrounds and courses of study. Graduate and undergraduate students are given a chance to learn about aspects of conservation biology, ecology, veterinary medicine, genetics, animal science, agriculture, sociology, business, computing, graphic design, education and tourism.\
\
CCF is an official fourth year placement for students from Namibia\'92s two major universities, University of Namibia (UNAM) and Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST). In addition, CCF welcomes interns from undergraduate and graduate university programs all over the world.\
\
Aspiring biologists, genetics, and ecologists pursuing Masters and Ph.D. degrees come to CCF to work on research and thesis projects all year.\
\
Interns help with tasks that include:\
\
- cheetah feeding - collecting and dissecting cheetah feces\
- observing cheetah behavior - assisting in clinical work-ups\
- raise livestock guarding dog puppies - conducting field work\
- being involved with outreach and education programs\
\
Volunteering\
\
Volunteering at CCF in Namibia is a rewarding experience, and most of the people who participate in our volunteer program will tell you that it is among the best experiences they have ever had. Volunteers do everything from data entry and camera trap photo sorting to chopping up meat to collecting and cataloging scat samples.\
\
Like interns, volunteers can expect to work on a variety of tasks. CCF also seeks professionally skilled volunteers to work as cheetah keepers, animal behavior specialists, ecologists, biologists, veterinarians, and vet-technicians, as well as educators, trainers, and conservationists.}
