\f0\fs24 \cf0 Famers as Conservationists\
\
Farming alters natural systems, yet farmers can be good conservationists. If the farm is run wisely the land will produce year after year.\
\
Farmers collect data that is important for understanding the ecosystem. They measure rainfall, count wildlife and many participate in other census studies. This data is used to develop wildlife-friendly farming practices geared for sustainable use.\
\
Sustainable Use practices include:\
\
Allowing wildlife to move freely through the farm and selectively harvesting to preserve a balanced ecosystem.\
\
Keeping livestock numbers low and rotating them through camps to allow recovery of vegetation.\
\
Using non-lethal predator control methods allow predators, prey and livestock to share a well balanced habitat.\
\
Setting areas of a farm aside as \'93wild lands\'94 or \'93buffer zones\'94 to maintain original plants.\
\
We must be responsible custodians of the land and wildlife!}
