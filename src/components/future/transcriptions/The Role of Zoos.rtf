\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Role of Zoos\
\
Moderns zoos serve as conservation education centers and provide sanctuary for many endangered species. Cooperative breeding, management and research have assisted in re-establishing some species in the wild.\
\
Historically, cheetahs have not bred well in captivity. In recent years, through cooperative research and management in zoos worldwide, a global master plan is producing successful results. If future extinction were to occur with wild cheetahs this research and maintained captive populations could allow the re-introduction of cheetahs.\
\
Research\
\
Zoos, universities, private individuals, governmental and NGOs support cooperative efforts worldwide.\
\
Reproductive, medical and behavioral studies, and laboratory analysis are cooperative conservation efforts between captive and wild cheetah.\
\
Ambassadors\
\
As representatives of the wild cheetah, zoo animals provide the opportunity for people around the world to see a cheetah close up.\
\
Through educational programs, zoos spark the interest of individuals who can support or join the projects that will save wild cheetahs.\
\
Zoos contribute to the conservation of wild cheetahs through education, research and support.}
